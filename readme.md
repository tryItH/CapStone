### Predicting Lung Cancer

Hima Paladugu

#### Executive summary
This project is meant to predict whether the person has Lung cancer or not 
#### Rationale
The effectiveness of cancer prediction system helps people to know their cancer risk with low cost and it also helps the people to take the appropriate decision based on their cancer risk status

#### Research Question
How to visualize and predict Lung cancer using 5 different models

#### Data Sources
Survey Lung cancer dataset includes various columns such as gender, age, smoking, yellow fingers, anxiety, peer pressure, chronic disease, fatigue, allergy, wheezing, alcohol consuming, coughing, shortness of breath, swallowing difficulty, chest pain, and lung cancer. By analyzing these variables and using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations, the predictive models can provide accurate assessments of a patient's risk of developing lung cancer.

#### Methodology
Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine SVM model and Random Forest Model

#### Results
K-Fold Cross validation shows Logistic Regression model gives most accuracy of 90%
